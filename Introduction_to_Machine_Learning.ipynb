        "   * ***Grew out work in AI:*** It turns out that machine learning is a field that had grown out of the field of Artificial Intelligence(AI). We wanted to build intelligent machines and it turns out that there are a few basic things that we could program a machine to do such as how to find the shortest path from A to B. But for the most part we just did not know how to write AI programs to do the more interesting things such as web search or photo tagging or email anti-spam. There was a realization that the only way to do these things was to have a machine learn to do it by itself [1].\n",

        "  Supervised learning problems are categorized into \"regression\" and \"classification\" problems. In a regression problem, we are trying to predict results within a continuous output, meaning that we are trying to map input variables to some continuous function. In a classification problem, we are instead trying to predict results in a discrete output. In other words, we are trying to map input variables into discrete categories.\n",

        "      So, this is an example of a Supervised Learning algorithm. The term Supervised Learning refers to the fact that we gave the algorithm a data set in which the, called, \"right answers\" were given. That is we gave it a data set of houses in which for every example in this data set, we told it what is the right price. So, what was the actual price that house sold for, and the task of the algorithm was to just produce more of these right answers such as for this new house that your friend may be trying to sell.\n",

        "  Unsupervised learning allows us to approach problems with little or no idea what our results should look like. We can derive structure from data where we don't necessarily know the effect of the variables.\n",
        "  \n",
        "  Given this data set, an Unsupervised Learning algorithm might decide that the data lives in two different clusters. And so there's one cluster and there's a different cluster. And yes, Supervised Learning algorithm may break these data into these two separate clusters. So this is called a clustering algorithm.\n",
