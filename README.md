# Machine-Learning-Tutorial

    This blog is on different machine learning algorithms.
 ------------

#### Q1. What is Machine Learning?**

   *Ans:* There's a science of getting computers to learn without being explicitly programmed.

 
 #### Q2. Why is machine learning so prevalent today?

   *Ans:* 
    
   * ***Grew out work in AI:*** It turns out that machine learning is a field that had grown out of the field of Artificial Intelligence(AI). We wanted to build intelligent machines and it turns out that there are a few basic things that we could program a machine to do such as how to find the shortest path from A to B. But for the most part we just did not know how to write AI programs to do the more interesting things such as web search or photo tagging or email anti-spam. There was a realization that the only way to do these things was to have a machine learn to do it by itself.
   
   * ***New capability for computers:*** Machine learning was developed as a new capability for computers and today it touches many segments of industry and basic science.
   
   * ***Examples:***
     * Database Mining.
     * Application can't program by hand.
     * Self-customizing programs.
     * Understanding human learning(brain, real AI).
